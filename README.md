CiscoCodeMimTest

This is the first time I've looked for a job in a very long while, and my very first code challenge ever.  Apologies I lost a few days with a dying computer having to install everything on my wifeâ€™s computer and start over, no excuses just took an extra few days is all.  This is my first-time using GitHub, we use git at work but didn't have a GitHub account so hopefully I've done that part correctly, please let me know if not, and you might need me to submit project by some other means.

add ./ for linux

gradlew build

gradlew run
- enter string less that 30 characters
- java popup is terminal

gradlew test
